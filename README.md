# EasyEmas

essentially a glorified moodle time table. developed by Emir Muhamad Zaid, with the sole purpose of getting your "Deadliner" badge to a whole new level.
this py file will show your current assignments that is not overdue yet, when is the deadline and how much free time you have.
it is developed using the University of Indonesia moodle platform (emas.ui.ac.id) and (emas2.ui.ac.id), but it could work with any other moodle platform as long as it allows the moodle mobile app api and some modification.

for emas.ui.ac.id use the EasyEmas.py . for emas2.ui.ac.id use the EasyEmas2.py .
